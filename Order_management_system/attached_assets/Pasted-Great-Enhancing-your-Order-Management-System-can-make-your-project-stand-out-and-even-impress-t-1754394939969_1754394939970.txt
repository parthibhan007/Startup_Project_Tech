2. **Order Sorting**

3. **Pagination**

   * If orders are many, implement pagination or infinite scroll for better performance

4. **Status Color Tags**

   * Use color-coded chips for statuses (Delivered, Pending, Shipped, Cancelled)

5. **Toast Notifications**

   * Use toasts for:

     * Success or failure on order creation
